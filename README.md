# banIP-IP-blocklists

This repo contains the IPv4/IPv6 addresses of ad-/porn-related external domain/host files. Currently the following external feeds are supported:  
* oisd-basic (see https://oisd.nl/ for details)  
* oisd-nsfw (see https://oisd.nl/ for details)  
  
The `banIP-lookup.sh` script runs automatically twice a day via github actions to extract and update the IP addresses of the external feeds.  

**Caution: This is experimental for further banIP development**  

Have fun!
