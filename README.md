# banIP-IP-blocklists

This repo contains the IPv4/IPv6 addresses of commonly whitelisted domains and hagezi lists for personal use. Currently the following external domain feeds are supported:

* hagezi, see https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists for details

The `banIP-lookup.sh` script runs automatically once a day via github actions to extract and update the IP addresses of the external feeds.

Have fun!
